# Humanoid Robotics

One thing that we have learned from the study of humanoids is that there is a vast numberof possible applications for them.  Security is one field where these humanoid robots havepotential to be applied. One of the advantages of having a robot guard is a lack of emotionalnuance that can be perceived as more authoritative than a human guard.

In this project we have developed a humanoid guard robot that interacts with people thatapproach it.  Its sole purpose is to grant access to people with proper credentials and keepintruders off.  More specifically, face detection is used to detect an approaching person.  Itthen initiates a dialogue, asking for credentials.  If the person is authorized, the robot willgreet the them.  Otherwise, the robot will ask the person to leave.  If the person refuses toleave, the robot will become hostile, point a firearm at them and eventually shoot the intruder.

The purpose of this project has been to design and construct this robot to get a better under-standing of robotics hardware and software such as Robot Operating System (ROS) and toapply basic algorithms from computer vision and mechanical dynamics.
